## This is the PFS5 scenario. It creates a network with topology 0 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 and 0 <-> 4 <-> 3
## where 0 <-> 4 <-> 3 doesn't have enough capacity to make a second transfer and hence the other path
## is used for that transfer. This also checks that the PFS reacts correctly to the capacity update.
